Describe your project specifications or link to project documentation or guidelines.

## Abstract 

The Alpine Groove Guide provides a dynamic platform for local artists and event organizers to share their events with a wide audience. The system supports event submission, which goes through an admin review process where events can be accepted, denied, or edited. Approved events are then displayed on the public-facing calendar. The platform is designed to eventually support streaming of community radio shows, further engaging the local creative community.

## Learning Goals

- Develop a full-stack application using a modern JavaScript stack.
- Implement user authentication and admin authorization for content management.
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive design.
- Integrate PostgreSQL for robust data management.
